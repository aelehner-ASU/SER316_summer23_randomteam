# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions, please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Anna Lehner

**Git Master**: Bereket Amonie

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Transform memoranda to better fit gym scheduling system by adding new UI elements and new functionality.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**
> 10

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> All ten.

**Why did you add these US? Why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**
> This is the last sprint, and we can not be done with all user stories.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**
> The US added, guide us on fixes that will help us in the longer run. For example, testing functions will 
> be easier to understand without incorrect messages or random characters.

**Do you have a rough idea of what you need to do? (if the answer is no, then please let me know on Slack)**
> Yes.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to fill out already the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|

| 6/27 | Tanya  | US tasks, approve pulls | n/a  | n/a | none |
| 7/01  | Tanya | Updating on status | n/a  | n/a  | none |
| 7/04 |  Tanya |Updating on status | n/a  | n/a | none |
| 7/07 |  Tanya | Update Git, finish Deliverable | n/a  | n/a | none |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Alan : 4
   Chris : 4
   Bereket : 4
   Anna : 4
   Tanya : 0


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
> Poor communication is the main hurdle to the project, and we are discussing how to improve communication.


**Screen Cast link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEUFY8lVSQU

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We were eventually able to lay the groundwork for the application that could be turned into a gym app. New interfaces were created

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Team members worked their hardest to contribute as much as possible to the project.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> No, we could not modify the whole memoranda to the GYM system.  


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence-based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Our sprint goal was not met as we did not manage to finish all our Spint US. We must continue to work on our communication skills and work better as a team. There was a lot of confusion towards the beginning but got our bairing together towards the end.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> We did not finish all of our User Stories as we had 3 User Stories still in need of completion

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Terrible communication skills, with some confusion, cost us a lot of time which made us behind schedule.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> We did not work at a consistent rate as the first week we spent mostly coordinating together rather than spending working on the US.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We delivered some business value as we did progress with the project but not a sufficient amount.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We must work better on meeting 3 times a week to conduct StandUp meetings.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We have a lot to work on, but we have the potential to have a very efficient team.
